# RFID_SmartLock
This is a prototype of an RFID lock named BagTag. 



<h1> The BagTag </h1>

This project was initiated as part of the ***2019 Toyota Logistics and Design Competition***. Four highly skilled students from the COSC150 course at UBC Okanagan were tasked with solving a logistic issue in modern society which led to designing and producing a working prototype of an RFID smart lock.

The concept behind the project was to address the issue of luggage theft at airports, specifically targeting baggage claim areas. With billions of dollars worth of lost or stolen bags reported every year, this product has significant applications for both personal and commercial use. When combined with our proprietary luggage tracking software, the RFID smart lock serves as a fully independent, secure tracking and logistics system that would benefit airports, airline companies, and their customers.

The prototype was built using an Arduino for ease of use testing and was designed to be functional and presentable within a strict timeline and small budget. The prototype housing was intentionally designed to be large enough to house the Arduino, wiring, speaker, lighting, and a 9V battery, which wirelessly powers the lock at the moment. The final product design is compact and made of reliable and resilient materials, with an IP68 rating and shock absorption, while also considering modern fashion trends.

Please refer to the attached presentation folder for a video demonstration of the working prototype and a shortened version of the in-class presentation showing a different stage of design and testing. You will also find the final completed code used on the prototype in the src file above. Design files and more information will be attached for your reference in the near future.
